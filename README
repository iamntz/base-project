I always hated to create few folders and few files every time I start a project.

Some time ago I created a archive that contain few files and some basic folder structure 
but I quickly find out that is a odd method and too many steps where involved in updating.

And because I just discovered Git, I also just discovered bash prompt. 
So I created a quick bash script with all the stuff I need.

You just need to copy `baseproject` in your home directory and make a SymLink of i.bash to home directory.
To do so, in opne a bash prompt and type:

ln ~/baseproject/i.bash ~/i.bash

That's all! All you have to do now is to right click a directory (on windows, I really don't know how it works on other platforms!) 
and chose „Bash Prompt Here*” then type: ~/i.bash .

* if you don't have „bash prompt here”, install chere in your cygwin distribution then type 
chere -i
in a cygwin console.

All files are created.

Bonus:
1) the script ask me if I want to use jQuery
2) the script also ask me if I want to init a git repo and if I want to commit
