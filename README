I always hated to create few folders and few files every time I start a project.

Some time ago I created a archive that contain few files and some basic folder structure 
but I quickly find out that is a odd method and too many steps where involved in updating.

And because I just discovered Git, I also just discovered bash prompt. 
So I created a quick bash script with all the stuff I need.

You just need to copy `base_project` and `i.bash` on your home directory. 
hint: make a hardlink to i.bash to keep it updated ;)

Now, every time I open console I just type:

~/i.bash

All files are created.

Bonus:
1) the script ask me if I want to use jQuery
2) the script also ask me if I want to init a git repo and if I want to commit
